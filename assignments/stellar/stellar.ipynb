        "The classical accuracy used in classification, when there is unbalanced classes, looses reliability. Imagine, for instance, a dataset with 99% of instances of a class A, and only 1% of class B. If we apply a dummy classifier that classifies everything as A, we will obtain an accuracy of 99%, which suggests excellent performance, but clearly this classifier will not be working correctly. For this reason accuracy is rarely used with unbalanced datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "One of the most commonly used metrics with unbalanced data is F1, which is defined as the harmonic mean of the precision and recall:\n",
        "\n",
        "$F1 = 2 \\times \\frac{\\text{precision} \\times \\text{recall}}{\\text{precision} + \\text{recall}}$.\n",
        "\n",
        "F1 is defined in a range from zero to one, with one corresponding to a perfect classification. The definition is made for binary classification problems, so it needs to be adapted to multi-label problems like the one we are dealing with. Scikit applies F1 to each class separately, obtaining several F1 values, which it then groups by means of an average. There are several methods to do this grouping. More information in [Scikit-Learn reference documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.f1_score.html).\n",
        "\n",
        "Another approach to deal with an unbalanced dataset is to make it a balanced one. The most straightforward way to this is to simply undersample the majority class or oversample the minority class. A variation of the latter is to add noise to the oversampling in a controlled way, so as to bring more variety to the dataset, avoiding overlearning. In the context of Deep Learning this technique is known as \"data augmentation\".\n",
